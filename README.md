Try to click me
================
This is a small game created using html and javascript.
You try to click on the 'try to click me' button.
The timer will count down and radomize the position and location of the click me and don't click me buttons.
Another don't click me button is added every correct click.
If you click on the 'don't click me button' or the timer reaches 0 the game will reset.
The number of clicks is recorded.

Medium - skips to 30 clicks
Hard - skips to 50 clicks
Very Hard - skips to 80 clicks

The game gets harder and harder.
After:
10 clicks - time decreases to 8 sec
20 clicks - every click adds an extra (clicks/10) don't click me buttons
30 clicks - decrease to 5 sec
40 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 3-sec (still 8 sec time limit)
50 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 2-sec (now 10 sec time limit)
60 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 1-sec (still 10 sec time limit)
80 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 0.8-sec
90 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 0.6-sec
100 clicks - re-randomize the buttons every 0.4-sec
